### Git commander exercise

---

I used to use GitKraken application for mananging my programming files.
So, I found that when I am coding without like those programs, I cannot manage my code versions, even hard to share with others.

This repo is just few files for exercising git commmand with my editor, Visual Studio code.

#### ðŸ“Œ Remote Repository

---

We can manage our files on our computer, local computer.
However, we need to share codes when programming, especially for collaborations.

Github helps us this, and it called `remote repository`

**Commands:**
`origin`:
`github-id` : github user id

```
  gir remote add origin https://github.com/github-id/
```

<br>

#### ðŸ“Œ Add file

---

Choose files that I want to upload.

If want to all updated files, just write `. (dot)` instead of each files' name.

**Commands:**

```
  git add "file name"

  git add "."
```
