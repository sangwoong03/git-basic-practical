### Git commander exercise

---

I used to use GitKraken application for mananging my programming files.
So, I found that when I am coding without like those programs, I cannot manage my code versions, even hard to share with others.

This repo is just few files for exercising git commmand with my editor, Visual Studio code.

#### ðŸ“Œ Add file

Choose files that I want to upload.

If want to all updated files, just write ". (dot)" instead of each files' name.

```
  git add "file name"

  git add "."
```
